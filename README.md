Introduction to My Github Hazel-1212
Iã€€have heard of Github before but never operated it. 
To showcase my past experiences and my resolution to learn new knowledge, I give Github a shot.
In this repo, I recollect my preceding c++ or Python learning.
Besides, it also includes the creation called Optical Communication,which is what my friends and I co-founded in senior high school.
Thank SDC and lecturers of Kronos Research for reading information!
